----------------------------------------------
Story so far:
There was a boy!
He woke up very early one morning.
He wanted to find his lost sock.
He found the sock near the fireplace.
The boy tried to wear the sock.
The sock has something in it.
It was a present.
Someone told him that a weird fat unshaved white-bearded pervert wearing red clothes climbed his roof and chimney last night. 

That's how the legend of "Santa Claws" was born. Santa Claws was shot later that week because he was a drunk that did weird things with children socks and always left them a surprise present inside the sock!
After many-many years a group of people now named "flat earth believers" did not believe that Santa Claws was a pervert and he was actually a nice old grandpa with white beard that has animals that fly. At the begging he has one animal : "Adolf the Green Eared Mole" but then (again after some years) it switched to "Yellow Rain Eel" and finally we ended with Rudolf!
Also Santa was renamed later to Santa Claus cause of copyright reasons!
