Thank you for paying money to buy this amazing holiday game! You can also order the FindSanta game which it's a completely different game than this! 
The game features complex RPG elements. You select different characters with different behaviour!  
Some characters can always find EasterBunny and some others will never find him!!! 
Choose wisely!
----------------------------------------------
Story so far:
There was a boy!
He woke up very early one morning during Easter time.
He wanted to find his lost sock.
He found the sock near the fireplace.
The boy tried to wear the sock.
The sock has something in it.
It was an egg.
Someone told him that a weird bunny wearing red clothes climbed his roof and chimney last night. 

That's how the legend of "Easter Bunny Claws" was born. EasterBunny Claws was shot later that week because it was a drunk that did weird things with children socks and always left them a surprise present inside the sock!
After many-many years a group of people now named "flat earth believers" did not believe that EasterBunny Claws was a pervert and he was actually a nice old grandpa with white beard that has animals that fly. At the begging he has one animal : "Adolf the Green Eared Mole" (there are similar references to the Myth of Santa Claus!) but then (again after some years) it switched to "Yellow Rain Eel" and finally we ended without any animal frieds because all animals (even the turtle) were already present in other stories and had copyright issues!
Also EasterBunny was renamed later to EasterBunny Claus cause of copyright reasons!
