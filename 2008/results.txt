The winner of CSSCGC 2008 is a game that is fantastically crap! With vivid, 
colourful and detailed block graphics and gameplay and plot that just ooze
originality. It's got a pretty wicked streak of humour too which caused much
hilarity when played with office workmates. But, what makes it hilarious for me
is the final message at what you think is the end of the game, telling the
player that they are still in the game for another 67 years. In effect I am
still playing it now! It has also unsurprisingly been reviewed by
SnakeOilSteve in one of the earlier CSSCGC 2008 tape magazines.

This game was by far the most popular title of CSSCGC 2008, being mentioned on 
various channels all over the Internet. It certainly caused quite a stir. 
Firstly I should say it is truly amazing and technically brilliant. I never
thought I'd see anything like this attempted, but the game surely works and
it's pretty jaw-dropping to see something like this running on a speccy for the
first time, even if the graphics are naturally blocky. It makes me wonder what
possible things can be achieved even further into the future. People may say,
well DP , this is far too good to be in 2nd place, but I'd have to reply,
"play it" and you will see it is at heart another quintessentially crap gaming
experience!

This game is clearly hilarious. You positively can't help but laugh at the
action of the head at the bottom of the screen as it eats the crap and the
simple text comments are just brilliant. I was also amazed by the vast number of
combinations of graphics characters in the program listing needed in order to
give the crap a realistic animation. It only didn't win due to the technically
of it more being like a sh*teating demo than a fully interactive game.
However, half a point was clawed back for the funky haircut on the horizontal
sh*teating maniac at the bottom of the screen. 

Kabaddi

A fascinating idea to base a game on Kabaddi, which poses the question "how
would the dynamics of the sport be implemented?".
The cunning idea of using the INPUT command in such a repetitive manner was 
really what made this game truly crap I thought, so bonus points for that. 
Also extra points for the large block graphics reminiscent of many Atari 2600
cartridges. This game made me realise how awful I am at typing! We just
need a "quick brown fox" type game similar to this one now so I can improve my
skills across the whole keyboard! Of course I could have slowed down my typing,
but as this is Kabaddi, I felt the psychological need to keep the pace up whilst
playing.

I love the intro sounds, reminiscent of a 50's B movie monster flick. Crapness
abounds from the inability of the player sprite to change orientation, the
complete sparseness of the play area, the dodgy collision detection with the
dots. But an extra point is scored for the fact that when all dots are eaten,
you just wonder around the dotless screen for eternity, or until you get killed.
A nice touch and made me laugh anyway.

An exquisite idea, and it actually really works! Certainly, this program has
pushed out the limits of the crap game compo yet again and you can now run crap
games within a crap environment, making them even more crap. I have to ask what
level of motivation does someone have, going to such lengths to code something
so brilliantly crap? 
But then again the CGC relies on such hardcore dedication. This will be one to
remember and we even had a stream of bugfixes and updates for it from the author
who always provides an excellent level of support.

A solid piece of crap game craftsmanship, and one that goes to the trouble of
detecting which platform it is running on. Ticks all the right boxes in terms of
unnecessary delays and humorous instruction screen. An extra point added for
mentioning the word "bovril" somewhere in the on-screen instructions. Let's
assume that you play the part of Lynda Bellingham trying to drive home from the
supermarket (or was she OXO, I never can remember?). To increase the fun, play
this whilst watching re-runs of "The Sweeney" on ITV4.

Yes, I did it! I got to level 42 so I then went to dig out my old unofficial 
"Level 42" T-shirt from the eighties, but it had been long since gone missing. 
Great crap idea to have an "infinite" number of levels, however I'm questioning 
if there really is an integer variable integer variable wraparound so that if
you played this game until the Sun went supernova, would it reset back to zero? 
Funny thing is you actually get quite skilful at playing the game after ten
minutes or so. The game scores very well due to total lack of in-game objects
(and objectives) also its ability to foster an atmosphere of despair, but in an
oh so colourful way!

Now this one really is neat and any self respecting machine code hobbyist must
gape in awe at this. Embedding the entire machine code for the game and the
stack and variables too in the lower part of the screen must rank as something 
to make you say.. "ecky thump! that's really neato..". Just think - a full game
inside a .SCR file! You could upload the game and the screenshot to the WoS
archives in one single upload operation and then earn yourself a cup of tea with
the time saved. Again the game features overly good graphics and sprite routines
from Woody, even if the playability is at CGC standards. But it's impossible not
to be impressed with the whole concept. Woody even provided a POKE for this one
which will no doubt end up in the Tipshop at some point!

As I reviewed this one for the Dec tape mag, it's really no secret that I liked
it. 
As mentioned in the review itself this sort of thing really oozes a wholesome
crapness, but IMHO of that peculiar variety that hopefully will be more
forthcoming in the future crap game compos. 
Not just that I actually enjoy the bubble sort game, but the "vicious panda"
character really does give some extra amusement. 
Surely a speccy game character to go down in a "top 100" game character list
along with Dizzy the Egg, the slightly less famous Pippo and Gordon the Alien.
The bubble sort algorithm was lifted from a type-in book - good to see someone
is still using these type-ins even if it is just for the CGC.

Think back to the movie "Flight of the Navigator", remember the scene where our
young protagonist is within the alien spaceship (and life form) and he is
introduced to all manner of creatures from around our galactic neighbourhood and
beyond. Well, one of those creatures is a rather large eye, which actually
screams "eye-eye-eye-eye" in English when disturbed. This is the basis for this
game from Dr BEEP. Actually it isn't but I was reminded of this nevertheless.
I mean the eye is just so huge! As previously mentioned it is reminiscent of
operation games such as "Life & Death" on the ST/Amiga and others (actually were
there any others?). If you can overcome any squeamishness you may have or fear
of hospitals, then it's a satisfying and highly unique little diversion for a
few minutes.

Frightened as I was by this game's on-screen insistence that I do not use any
loading acceleration in my emulator, I did the right thing and booked a day off
work in order to playtest it. (Not really but I think I was off this day anyway,
fortunately!) After three and a half hours or so of watching Space 1999 DVDs,
whilst keeping one eye on the game loading, it was apparent that my chosen word
begin with 'M' or thereabouts. I lost the game in the end, but I needed to,
since I had to get a decent screenshot of the hangman. Then of course I realised
later that the author had already thoughtfully supplied an in-game screenshot.
Nice original concept, so I give this one a high score. I think it will go down
as the largest title (in bytes) ever submitted to ANY CGC competition to date.

This game is crap on so many levels, it's frightening. First of all, the spectre
of local radio late night shenanigans is let loose into the CSSCGC which is
bound to "hit the ground running" when it comes to crap achievements. 
It's an almost surreal translation of something that was perhaps lost in
translation even in the original format and a seriously stale joke to boot.
The hand animation at the beginning (presumably the element which requires the
+2A/+3 hardware) is just awesome, being even too funky for Gaz Top. 
A well deserved high crapness score, and a Radio Leeds car sticker and balloon

obscure the player's car sprite at regular intervals and also have certain
long, sharp corners seem almost impossible to escape from. You've just gotta
love that extra touch of the block-graphic solitary cloud hanging in the sky.
Indeed, a perfect day for driving towards the seemingly unreachable distant

Brownie points earned for general sluggishness, no mention of the in-game keys
prior to or during play. But the piece d'resistance is the suspension of the
main game loop during the firing of the boat's torpedo. Excellent "riveted

action titles such as Xenon! Nicely done. A vintage crap entry for sure.

now "Four crap games in one year...". OK this is actually alright. I played it a
fair bit and got familiar it. Dazzled as I was by the very professionally done 
graphics, I'm also a sucker for any sort of game with puzzle elements and where 
you move a sprite based entity around the screen, trying to solve it on a 
per-level basis. For me it brought back vague memories of Boovie, but of course
this is a totally different game with different rules and mechanics. Too good
for the CGC but welcome it was nonetheless and the high score reflects the 
quality that this title just oozes and serves as a hopeful encouragement for
future CGCs that this is the level of effort that we like to see in the compo!

Here's another one that's actually quite good as games go. I've certainly spent
many a weekend in my youth entering enormous type-ins into various 8-bit
computers with the end result seldom looking as good as this graphically. It is
a long time now between the submission of the game and the writing of these
results (almost a year in fact) But IIRC, the author insisted that the game was
nowhere near as good as it should've been - which makes it ideally placed to get
a good score in the CGC as it stands. The "flat top" shaped head of the 
crucified in-game messianic character looked suitably comical for this game and
also the rather amusing use of an aerosol as a weapon just cries out 
originality. I suppose rather predictably, I can't help but think of the "Always
look on the bright side of life" tune when playing it.

This is certainly an artisan entry in the annals of the CGC. The thrills and

track layout has been painstakingly entered into DATA statements in the pursuit 
of an accurate and realistic text simulation. I just love the use of FLASH 
attribute on the chequered flags on the track selection screen. Make your way 
around one or two of the tracks by all means but a quest to play every track

This is a good example of a crap game. A nice green screen retro feel, and some

so nice effort. Of course all games are suitably crap, and there's not a 
tremendous replay value. However, the games do run shockingly fast. In fact, a
bit too fast for a crap game, we just don't expect such well optimised coding
around these parts! Bubu clearly needs to study the source code from 
"Un-space Invaders" by Apenao in order to "crap-up" his graphics routines a bit
more.

have no doubt. We also know this one has depth, because (a) it takes place under

Out of BloodBaz's two entries this year, this is by far the best crap effort. 
Guide your swiftly moving pixel around the screen avoiding hitting its own path
or the edges of the play area. Perhaps the code could be adapted to make an 
etch-a-sketch simulator? Clever intro screen which for a second tricks the user 
into thinking they may be starting a 3D game, before "3D" changes to "2D" with 
an accompanying low frequency BEEP sound. Brings us right back down to Earth
with a bump like any crap game should do! 
Verdict: A fair effort, but when held up against "Advanced PURPLE loading

Quite a respectable crapness rating for this one. The player is initially left
confused as to what to do apart from moving aimlessly around the screen in the
midst of the ongoing interplanetary battle and the frame rate is suitably low 
for an invaders game written in BASIC. What really pushed this game up the 
scoreboard though is the graphic routine which only allows you to see the alien
sprites for about half the time, as they are rubbed out during the other half.
Well done! Nice "alternative" game concept also. At least the UDGs are finely
detailed and gleefully colourful.

Enjoy this all ye followers of the Timex- for this is your reward for possessing

This is certainly a crap game, and for all the right reasons. As you push the

goat is moving downwards, I can't help but sit there and think "the BEEP pitch
should decrease!" Add in a dramatic long wait for the "goat verdict" (like in
some reality TV game show) and also the fact that the player has no control over
the game whatsoever apart from pressing a single key (a lá "Eat Shit!") make
this game achieve a respectable crapness score. A nice touch is the text screen
describing the history of the goat throwing practice in this area of Spain. I've
never seen anything like that sort of "Tourist Information Board" in a crap game

historical tradition has now been superseded by the throwing of a cardboard

Yet another showcase of Woody's advanced machine code skills and trickery.
Marvel at the spaceflight segment, followed by the part where you have to escape
a seemingly invisible maze on the planet's surface. Ho ho, you might exclaim! 
"That's a funny gag, the maze is invisible. This is comedy genius, I must say." 
But therein lies yet another twist unbeknownst to the casual player as I once 
was.
You see, revealing the secrets of this game is rather like peeling layers from
an onion - i.e it may make you want to cry. Play this on either a real speccy or
on the most recent versions of SpecEmu and you will actually see the maze become
perfectly visible - due to some little known quirk causing colour1 PAPER on 
colour2 INK to have slightly different intensity than colour2 PAPER on colour1
INK! So think of this one as firstly a game, but secondly and emulator tester.
Good score awarded due to this neat technical trick.

One extra crap point scored for the fact that the letters don't get deleted off

game with traits of far more modern games. Because, what we basically have here
is a non-interactive cutscene. As for the interactive part of the game, well
it's a quick gag meaning success is again in the hands of pseudo random elements.
Or at least I think it is. I can't be totally sure, as I don't think I ever

This title has the restriction that you can only get into the later mini-games,
having earned it by playing the earlier ones first. 
Crickey, I must watch "300" at some point although I've had it in my film 
collection for ages I haven't got around to watching it just yet. I have to say 
though that some time and effort has clearly gone into making this game, for 
which the CGC is grateful. Also I like the way each mini game is coloured 
differently (And quite colourful they are too) and there are some nicely done 
UDG graphics. Yet, the game is steadfastly loyal to the realm of crapdom. 
So pat yourself on the back Apenao - a pretty good score.

A good showcase for demonstrating some of the capabilities of using Z88DK over
pure BASIC. The sliding screens found in the game look undeniably slick and the
block graphics are vibrant and supremely well drawn. 
Great effort with superbly drawn screens (Including those of the Pacman games,
which to me is always a welcome addition). Also thought it was a nice touch that
this game is specifically branded with a CGC '08 screen. Could've scored higher 
in the crapness stakes if written in BASIC, but I'm so glad it wasn't as the
resultant game is actually much better, having a real "Video Game" feel about
it. I can almost image playing this one in a MAME cabinet or something.
Seriously, nice work!

A considerable effort must've gone into generating the large number of comical
horse and race names. However the fact that the horse graphics are just too 
professional and the correct racing colour of green was used make the game too
"good". Perhaps if the official crap game colour of magenta were employed,
the score could've been increased by half a point. Thankfully though, the score
was boosted by incorrectly rounding pounds and pence and by requiring awkward
key presses to advance the game. Of course there are also the instructions,
which have the gall to refer to the player as "You sad git". How did he know,
is there a webcam in here or something?

OK, this is one of those games that made me really glad I did two passes of 
judging in this compo! For many of the entries I more or less got it right on
the first pass, but this game took a little bit longer for me to suss out.
When I played it for the first time, I admit I didn't have a clue what was going
on. On subsequent plays I got a bit further with it, getting all the way up to
"LOCATE INFRASTRUCTURE". The graphics on the space station in orbit around the
planet are superb as are the those of the enemies such as the Wirrn. A decent
crap game effort, featuring chip music on the intro screen. It's always a
pleasure for us fans of old series "Who" to combine that hobby with retro gaming
which doesn't happen all that often! Another amusing touch is that the 
"Instructions" are actually the backstory rather than the instructions which is
possibly why I didn't immediately "get it" on my first attempt at playing it!

Inspired by the classic game "UFO: Enemy Unknown", this apparently hastily put
together entry is rather hilarious. Taking less than an hour to write according
to Chris, the game nevertheless retains that air of mischievous "off the wall"
humour and jokey cynicism that characterise many of his other works.
First judging pass I wrote:-
"As I write this though I enter a state of mild panic as I realise that the
compo isn't halfway though yet, and in one previous year Chris submitted 14 
games to the CGC. How the heck am I still going to find interesting (or even
dull for that matter) comments to write about on that many possible further
games? Let's hope he doesn't do that to me! "
Second judging pass:-
"Phew, looks like things turned out fine just after all no matter how many
games were sent in, but why do I still keep getting recurring nightmares
featuring UFOs?"

The game is certainly crap, but hey if it's good enough for a mainstream TV 
channel, then it's crap enough for us! You just can't underestimate the glee I
had as I undertook the surreal experience of having to playtest the game many
times, not least on the Cambridge Z88 when I knew nothing about that platform 
until last year. So, I admire the style of this multi-platform release. 
Educational it was too, from an emulation learning standpoint. The game has
probably resulted in the creation of many more machine categories in the CSSCGC
than any previous game before it, so for that at least it will be well
remembered! 
Also, it begs the question "What was the most useful piece of software released
for the Z88?" Was it this, or did it have a huge underground p*rn market?
We never did get a Sam Coupe version though. Talk about seriously missed
opportunities! tut tut. To be fair though, I believe there was an issue with
keyboard mappings on the Sam Coupe emulator on Gavin's PC. 
And so, the CGC remains "Sam Coupe-less" for another year.
In any case, kudos for writing the FORTH version for the Jupiter ACE, one of
only two crap games ever (intentionally) written for that platform in its entire
history! I also believe this to be the only ever crap game entry for the
"Sinclair QL". Brilliant, and hence this oversized write-up. Just don't let 
actually playing the game spoil all of these CGC-firsts!

The main question is how this program works internally? Certain words seem to
generate a positive response whereas most words give a negative answer. I never
did get around to examining the FORTH source to reveal the complex machinations
or otherwise "under the bonnet" on this one. How intelligent can a Jupiter ACE
become? Nevertheless, the game is undoubtedly crap, and I give it a good score,
because the author kindly bailed me out when I had a rather silly looking ACE
arcade page with only a single game in it! 
Again, this will go down as only one of two crap games for the Jupiter ACE
submitted to the CGC, since as we all know it is not actually a Sinclair
machine. Certainly it is a "Sinclair derivative", although one which went down
its own development path, thanks to FORTH!
Will ACE games ever be allowed in the CGC again? I don't honestly know, but it
was good to have them on board in this experimental CSSCGC 2008!
Since I played this game, I was introduced to another web based 20 questions
game. This made me realise that this submission is like that web game, but with
human and CPU roles amusingly reversed. 
The only "secret" I have found so far in this program is that the delete key
doesn't work - so watch out for that and type carefully!

With this one, Jimmy managed to exceed even his own usual standards, by breaking
new ground with this VIC-20 emulator for the speccy. I have to confess to being
addicted to using this one as it re-awakened nostalgia of messing around on my
VIC-20 as a young child. So much so I ended up even developing a couple of
simple BASIC games within the emulated system, not that I should admit this
publicly. Again, it has to be said this program cannot win the competition as
it is by far too good an entry! I gave it a controversial high score though as I
have to respect the achievement even if it was entered into the "wrong" compo. 
Can't be helped though, since there is no compo called "8-bit emulators" as far
as I know. Just a reminder:- this entry is a real emulator, not a joke one!

just love those pretty little colourful sprites that appear on the screen on 
loading this one up. Strangely, this reminded me of my days of using the STOS
sprite editor on the Atari ST. This will no doubt be useful to people writing 
Timex games - I infer this by the number of times it was downloaded. My only
disappointment is that no third parties took it upon themselves to employ this
to submit yet another Timex entry, but I guess the number of Timex developers
is but a tiny fraction of speccy developers and alas nothing happened. 
However, who knows if there will ever be some sort of Timex Hunchback sequel? 
It was regrettable that this one could not be made available in the online "crap

It is crap this one, but in a delightfully retro way. Firstly, you can't die as

zooming in with a microfiche) if there were ghosts then you would not even see
them until they appeared on the adjacent square to the player by which time a
gobbling would be unavoidable. You should clear the maze (which once you have
started, you just have to finish - hunting down those annoying lost last couple

which involves the movement of planet Earth around the galaxy. This actually

doubt accommodating this particular incarnation. Again, you can't fail to be 
impressed at Woody's clear m/c mastery diverted down a CGC avenue, as one can't 
help thinking there's got to be some none-crap games along the pipeline

would have been solved in a little over twelve and a half days. Meaning that if 
you can't beat the computer within that sort of time frame, then you probably do
deserve to lose the game! The brute force algorithm is quite mesmerising to
watch in a fast emulator as the numbers fly back and forth across the screen, 
like there is indeed some diabolical intelligence going on behind the scenes,
although we know it uses a brute force method. Also, it sparked international

Dark humour is always bound to score quite well and the game is "open ended"

stress buster could have really benefited from just a little variety, perhaps
extending the longevity of the title. I somehow feel that the potential of this

As for the emulator itself, again it's a real genuine emulator and another 
technically impressive feat from Jimmy who has now built himself a reputation of

The second LOST game entered into CSSCGC 2008 makes me wonder what it is about
this TV series that has seemingly given it a lasting cultural impact. (alas I
have not seen it yet) Again, an amusing array of input options is provided on
the start screen, which is the hallmark of a Firelord release. We have come to
expect nothing less! I take it the main point of this game is to highlight how
each episode is painfully dragged out, which does seem to be a feature of many 
current day TV series. A unique and original touch is the inclusion of digital
photographs for viewing on a PC. These are critical for playing the game, since
they are referenced from the in-game text in lieu of actual ZX Spectrum
compatible images. The resolution may be much better this way, although I can't
help but speculate what the result would've been had these images been run
through a .SCR converter - crapper than this I presume?

This one momentarily gave me flashbacks of an obscure PC game from the mid-90's
called "Mind Grind", but I don't know why I'm mentioning it here since no-one
else on the planet has played it apart from me. I pitted my wits against the
(again highly artistically rendered) alien opponent but the bugger kept pipping
me at the post on every question. I finally did manage to outwit the alien once 
or twice but this game made me realise that mathematical ability is indeed
something that peaks around age 18 and then goes rapidly downhill from there.
Hope I never get invited onto the Krypton Factor.

This one is quite presumptive about the personal PC usage habits of CGC compo
hosts and the problems they are faced with - in a most hilarious way. Even if
Firelord did not write "by Firelord" on the intro screen, I could have told you
on the spot this was one of his. A mischievous brand of humour prevails and
Firelord's trademark INK/PAPER combinations are both on display here. You could
positively cack yourself at the drama and realism conveyed as time runs low and
there is real "trouble at mill". I just chuckled at the line stating "this all
happened because you were viewing adult material" or something to that effect!. 
Verdict: Well it made me laugh and it is crap - so a reasonable score for a 
text-dominated effort.

ranges from incredibly easy to certainly impossible with no real in-between. It
just depends on the generated maze. Another point I noticed was the shunning of
the USR "a" method of setting up UDGs, meaning that although the game quite
comfortably fits inside a 16K speccy memory-wise, the 16K end user would have to
go in and mod the code in order to see the intended stick man figure. Serves 'em

everything right for the CGC then I don't know what would. Colourful intro

Pre-scripted player task triggered by single key press, Check! Satisfying game

spent on the loading screen and five on the game. I could comment on the lack of
UDGs, but then again doesn't a lower case 'i' make great blade of grass!

Firelord mentioned that this game took 4.5 billion years to be completed - or in

coalescence of our rocky planet, via the formation of the "primeval soup" and 
eventually towards the evolution of the higher apes we finally reach what made
it all worthwhile - this ZX Spectrum crap game by Firelord of course. You see
that is "Chaos Theory" (From a glass, I pour some water on my hand) and say 
again you see - "Chaos Theory", look at that.
The game itself is rather chaotic with a full text exposition of a brutal live
ring fight. It almost reminds me of some MUDs I have played in the past, as 
the fight progresses - "Will I hit them or will I miss?" you think. Sometimes
you'll get a screen full of cyan on white text which isn't easy on the eyes but
did make wonder about the possibility of porting this one to the VIC-20.

This entry contrasts with some "real" emulators already in the compo.
It's a quick'n'dirty fake emulator, but a welcome one nevertheless, no thrills,

appears that may be the only line in the program which prevents it from running
on a 48K system? Technical concerns aside,  the author assures me he'd had a few
drinks whilst making this game, well that's really what I call dedication of
getting into the role of the game. For you play a drink happy journalist, 
although in this one the drink appears to be a "cuppa". I can't help think it's
a cuppa gin though. Playing this for the second time round I can't help but see
how topical the generated pseudo-headlines are for 2008. Which nicely dates it.

Anyway,  see if you can win it without much difficulty. I inadvertently won
it on my first go - as I'm sure many players would.
Looking at the code, only one parameter actually influenced the outcome of the

added realism?

beat the game by mentally "timing" the countdown such that I could get a really

did get "8 ticks" at one point. Ahhhrg, that was so near yet so far from the
ultimate goal of "7 ticks!" at which a treat is promised. Nice one if you were

green is employed here which is the one colour this game could only ever be.
(Unless there's ever a sci-fi version where a magenta lichen lawn is mowed on
a distant alien planet!) It's pretty obvious to the player that they could type 
"mow" to mow the lawn, but if you type "M" instead, you get a message telling
that you can just type "m" to mow the lawn. This abbreviation is very useful
since you need type it 384 times in order to complete the game, which for some
reason amuses me. Was I expecting too much for the game to say something like
"You push the mower forwards" or "You mow another strip of the lawn" after
typing "m"? Probably, as I guess that'd make it too easy!

the simple sound, or the fact that the "top of the sea" and the "depths below 
the sea" are merged into one flat surface, initially confusing the player. 
Woody needs to move the "lever of crapness" about two or three notches towards
"totally crap" in order to crap things up a bit more. I'm sure an Atari 2600
owner would rank this amongst one of their top ten games if it were on a 
deluxe bank switched cart.
Anyway, Woody can't help but provide an excellent level of support for most of 
his crap game efforts and so he eventually provided a 16K version of his game

I could be mistaken, but this has the look and feel of one of those "I already

Nothing wrong with that, in fact it was welcomed in 2008 and quite a few

You can play poker in it, but apparently it is not implemented correctly. So
that's at least partially crap, but the rest of game plays a little too good. 
It's a top-down view - a similar mechanism to Zelda series on the gameboy. 
Clearly also this one is firmly in the RPG genre, with what I'm guessing are 
Hit Points and Magic Points displayed on the screen.
I walked up a very long corridor whereupon I entered into a duel and won it,

of communication barriers between various sections of the home-brew retro-gaming

my CGC postings around the Internet and I have never seen any of theirs either.
So, the competitions go on as two isolated bubbles in a vast retro-gaming ocean.
In this game, I personally enjoy looking at such great mock usernames as "C64

modern day urban dangers setting the scene. The control system is impeded by a
user selectable level of drunkenness which is quite amusing at the lower levels

actually about the same speed as the enemy spaceship. So, if you hesitate and
then miss on the first firing you will be royally screwed. I also have to ask,
how big is the enemy ship sprite? 64x64 at a guess - how can you compete against

The fact that it is a fast paced game requiring skill and good timing (i.e. not

Heck it even comes with a highly amusing introductory blurb too. Meticulously

This one spawned a thread in the Spanish spec-chum community, with the

Music Demo

Score: 5.50
Ranking: 98th 
Platform: ZX Spectrum 48K & ZX Spectrum 128K
This is only the lowest scoring of Woody's entries because it is not actually a
game. However I nearly cacked myself with excitement at the prospect of this
BASIC extension, providing a SOUND command which can use either the Beeper or
the AY chip if available. Have an AY? Don't have an AY? That's fine, no-one
cares. Or at least the SOUND command doesn't. Your ears may tell a different
story. A great novelty for the CGC and it is nice that pre-128K owners are still
cared about. It is 2009, time to upgrade to 128K yet? No, thanks to Woody we are
rubberkeys fanatics till we die hahaha.... 
Correction: It isn't the lowest scoring of Woody's entries now, as Dumb Miner
is lower than this one. I forgot to change this on the 2nd pass of judging.

I actually think the barcode graphic in this game looks pretty damn good. Maybe
I should get the barcode scanner from work and try it out on the emulator screen
just to check that the generated codes to conform to the IEEE standards. Ahem,
anyway, some crapness points were scored for making a port from the ZX81 to the
Speccy whilst using zero of the speccy's features, making you think that you are
still actually playing it on a ZX81. Also, the score was saved from being lower
by the fact that it seems impossible to actually lose the game. (warning - 
expert crap game developers in the house). I see the BASIC code is there to lose
the game, but can it actually be lost? I couldn't do it and I did try a few
times! Quite possibly deserves a higher ranking, but judging this compo really
is like trying to pour a quart (the submissions) into a pint pot (the high
rankings) and this title was from a 1985 version!! Thanks for supplying the 
ZX81 version too though, the second one of only two in the compo.

You've just been given a nice clean bat, and what do you do with it? Cover it in
poo of course. I'm not cleaning that mess up! Amuse yourself for as long as you
wish in this game that seems to have no score, no winning conditions (or losing
conditions for that matter). I'd loved to have been there when the author was
designing the game and said to himself "hmm, we need exactly five stacks of
falling poo - no other number will do.). Score isn't too high as it is another
very short if fun listing that fits entirely on a single ZX screen. Would need
to add more to reach a higher score, like a poo-related power up or something! 
  
Advanced Disappointment Simulator 
by Andrew Owen
Filename: ads.tap
Score: 5.33
Ranking: 101st
Platform: ZX Spectrum 16K
This game is scored as follows: 2.33 for the game idea. 3.0 for the really cool
BORDER statements that make it look as if something is about to load up! Now
the compo is over, it is no spoiler to say simply what this game does. Namely 
it pretends to load up a ZX Spectrum port of the latter-day popular game 
"GTA 4" but immediately fails with a tape loading error. Hence the eponymous
disappointment. But I was asking myself, would I really be that disappointed if
it didn't load? What form could the game possibly take given the limited
hardware of the speccy. I wouldn't want to think what the frame-rate would be
like and even if there was a controversial "hot coffee" type mod available,
would it be worth it? As punishment for this, aowen should write "GTA 4 - the
text adventure" next year and increase the disappointment at least sevenfold!
For the history books, it's probably worth a mention that this title was
submitted merely one minute before the end of CSSCGC 2008.
Verdict: Slightly disappointing it may be, but we crave disappointment by the
bucketload!

Having not seen the TV program "Lost" yet, I was in fact quite lost as to what
do in this game at first. With hindsight, it's a safe bet that I wouldn't have
guessed the correct answer. However, a quick Wikipedia search filled me in on
the needed info and I was happily able to complete the game. A good crapness 
idea was to announce in the accompanying documentation that the player has
108 minutes in which to enter the correct numeric sequence and then completely
ignore this time limit in the game itself (as looking at the code reveals)!
Also, the game is quite unforgiving of whitespace, so don't press space
accidentally or it's goodbye planet Earth.

A fun poke at the trials and tribulations experienced by eleventh hour crap
game coders. Now we don't want everyone to think that the CGC has its head up
its own backside, but it's always amusing to get some self-referring titles. 
(Erm, didn't we get another one like this somewhere?) I played through this one
a few times and I either got totally confused or I swear that a multiple choice
answer I gave earlier was originally correct but later found to be wrong! 
I didn't look at the code but I assume it was written with the consummate skill

On hearing of this game it's easy to imagine visions of "Flight Simulator X"
type realism, or at least at the level of "Gunship". What we do get though is a
simple trick of perspective and a lovely magenta mower. I'll tell you what, the
way those clouds are moving across the sky, it's clearly blowing quite a gale
out there today. Better put your mittens on! Points deducted for allowing mowing
just slightly over the red line (An affront to civilised society) but as always
it just wouldn't do to underestimate the enduring cultural legacy the lawnmower
crap game series enjoys, so at least it scored above 5 - not bad!

No I'm sorry, this is just too damn good. Back in the day I paid good money for
games that were far worse than this one. It would have been rejected from the
cassette 50 compilation due to appearing far too skilfully drawn and would no
doubt be exploited as a separate commercial offering (not the only one in the
compo I feel this applies to). Amusing back story and interesting development
paradigm certainly makes it a worthwhile and unique entry to the CGC and the
whole concept is tantalisingly crap. However, back in 1983 it wouldn't have
been, so it only gets a low crapness score, yet plenty of playing time by me!

Unfinished masterpieces such as this should be applauded. We applaud them
because the author had the good sense to stop working on them and to give up.
Watch out CSSCGC 2009 though, this one may rear it's head though in the form of
a more completed experience. Have a BALL with it, but don't let it drive you
BATty. Reminds me very much of a one-liner program I co-authored a while back 
(in the early stages of development before the game was created).
To be fair to Shaun, I encouraged him to send this one in even though he'd made
it clear to me it wasn't finished. So I can't be too harsh now can I? Besides,
the full version (Drum roll please) is tipped to have some BEEPs in it and
a high score table. I know it's almost too exciting for me too, but I must stay
calm! (games to judge and all that)

OK, I confess I played this game a lot and I still haven't got the bottom of its
mysteries. I just keep getting the Jingle Bells tune (by FrankT) played whilst
the Elmo character displays a speech bubble, containing the letter I just
pressed repeatedly displayed. At doing this, the game is very good and I applaud
it.
The graphics of Elmo himself look rather professionally done, but I cannot seem
to unlock any further tunes or surprise messages from the game - which in a way
is "job well done" for something in the crap game compo. It did however bring
back fond memories of my early childhood as I watched "Sesame Street" many times
before eventually having to go to school (which never was quite as much fun).

This one looks great and the graphics are in no way crap. In fact you are
starting to think it is something like CUBASE and ask yourself, where do I
insert the dongle? The answer is probably in your ear if you listen to some of
the crap I came up with whilst messing around with this one. It is very slow as
Andrew acknowledges (good-oh!) So it's probably a case of "all fair coat and no
knickers" as when Mrs Hubbard the cupboard labelled "Machine Code", it in fact
contained BASIC. Getting near the end of the judging for me now and so I ask
myself have I lost the plot yet? Mr Bimble replies "No you haven't". 
Verdict: Looks good, feature packed and could be useful to game designers. Not
actually that crap!
Stop the press: Andrew has released a non-crap much further developed version
with more machine code in it. This is very good and "Mister BEEP" produced an
outstanding tune with it. Naturally, my judgement is solely of the earlier 
CSSCGC 2008 crap version.

The first of a three game assault on the compo by SB - likeable for its geek
appeal. You can possibly guess what's coming on starting the game, but still the
fact that someone actually wrote it will impel you to play the game through
to its logical conclusion provided you literally have two seconds to spare. 
Handy for completing on the short tube journey between Leicester Square and
Covent Garden (250 yards). Good for a short laugh of course. But after that,
the first three letters of the game name describe exactly what you should do
with it.
Stop the press: Obviously this game had some influence on me, since I submitted
the even worse "UnDoko" to CSSCGC 2009 - do you realise what you've started with
this?

This one being a sequel to the equally bad "Maze" from 2005, I launched the game
not honestly expecting it to blow my mind. Sure enough, it's a decent enough
crap-romp through a virtual tunnel. After my sins of 2007 I have no real right
to overly criticise this one, besides since I go through a tunnel twice a day
(the Mersey Tunnel) I guess I have some sort of affinity with it. Play with a
closed mind and you're sure not to be disappointed. I'm sure a future compo
awaits another sequel with great anticipation. But, will it take another three
years for this to happen?  In the words of Fairport Convention "Time will show
the Wiser". Although I was sorely tempted to develop an unofficial sequel to
this on myself, I later realised that it is a sacred tradition of the
CGC which belongs to chop983 alone.

This is too good for the CGC, so the low crapness score is out of respect for
the game more than anything else. This is a game where you absolutely have to
read the instructions to get an idea of how to play it. I had to play the first
level (Level 00) a few times before I finally beat it as I kept making the wrong
moves. In other words, you have to think ahead and very carefully as one wrong
move tends to blow the whole level.  With a hundred levels in the game I'll be 
sure to return to it again to complete some more of them. For me, it really is
the sort of Puzzle game that makes retro-gaming fun. Good to see a light colour
scheme in use too! Not crap game material although you might be excused for
thinking so (if you didn't read the instructions) but glad to have it in the CGC
anyway.

Advanced Paint Drying Simulator

This one achieved cult status as the 100th title to be entered into the 2008 CGC
, chronologically speaking. It does what it says on the tin (of paint). I once
painted the outside of a house and it looked a bit like this program. I kept
saying "that paint at the top will go darker as it dries, trust me". Of course
what really had happened was that two subtly different shades of paint were used
, so the house still to this day looks not unlike this program when it is half
completed. From a suggested idea by Andrew Owen, I thought for a moment this
program would itself evaporate into the vapourware section - but we
collectively groaned as it unstoppably became a reality, although the excellent
tin of pain graphic on the loading screen makes this one a cut above the very
lowest ranking entries.

In space, no-one can hear you scream. Unfortunately, I wasn't in space when I
received this one. Perhaps the next time a new interstellar probe is launched,
they can put the source code of this game inside it. Perhaps that is the only
way of getting rid of it. A game that certainly never could have been released
back in the day before USENET and web forums became widely used. This one 
certainly owes it's core idea to the Internet explosion and the fact that any of 
us can regrettably or perhaps deliberately become architects of a digital faux
pas. (erm, what am I going on about?) 
Anyway, the game is saved from "rock bottom" status by the inclusion of an
"Easter Egg", a close shave though I have to say.

The first thing that struck me about this title was the multicoloured loading
screen, which on the one hand looks great and really colourful due to stippling
effects, yet on the other hand looks somewhat corrupted in places. I'm guessing
(no pun intended) that this is the result of automatically converting it from
another graphics format. As for the "Turing test" itself, a look
"under the bonnet" of the code will reveal that the program is not that bright,
randomly spitting out a few everyday responses. However, you may say it
comfortably passes the Turing Test because I think I know some people who can be
mimicked flawlessly by this title.

Makes your 48K system appear identical to 16K one such that a 16K snapshot taken
from the resultant "emulated" system is indistinguishable from a real 16K
spectrum. Only two slight snags:- (1) the filling of the high 32K with $FF to
emulate "no attached RAM" truly takes ages. (2) you can still POKE the high 32K
and PEEK it back again betraying the presence of real RAM there. Still, in 
practise these things tend not to effect the operation of 16K software at all
(and the filling can be bypassed anyway). This one is actually potentially
useful since we could use it to run a 16K game with hard-wired UDG addresses in
the 48K QOAP emulator - if we really wanted to.
Not a game of course, but that doesn't seem to be important to anyone anymore.
Anyway, it seemed to fit into a nice gap here in the lower rankings of the
compo due to its theoretical usefulness.

Manic Miner that has been POKEd to make Miner Willy fall through floors
thereby rendering the game somewhat amusing yet completely unplayable. We like a 
bit of variety in the compo and I guess this sort of thing has never been
submitted before. So I'll just slap an appropriate low score of 3.57 on it and
be on my merry way, hoping wholeheartedly that next year we may see Dumb Set

Use of the word "cack" by me in the game's initial review was arguably a little
harsh, yet undoubtedly scientifically accurate. Furthermore "cack" is quite a

shadow of a doubt "cascade tape" filler material. In fact I had to play every
game in the original cascade tape, just to make sure that this wasn't one of
them. The low score reflects the fact that this one is one of those quickly
knocked up efforts that keeps the compo rolling on through dark winter nights.
I hope the low score does not dissuade the author from potential future crap
game efforts, because if "Cascade 50 Volume Two" ever hits the shelves then a
place on it must be reserved today for this one! Low ranking just reflects the
simplicity of the listing and the number of games in the compo. Otherwise,

This entry was submitted via "Text mode", an experimental feature of CSSCGC
2008 whereby entrants could post on forums or email me a piece of BASIC,
assembler or FORTH code for example and I would accept it as a submitted compo
entry. Perhaps this title has ensured that the experiment will never again be
repeated in the CGC. The title has one saving grace it is (or was at the time)
topical and also funny too, or at least I had to write something "funny" around
it on the site. An amazing trick is that this entry runs completely unmodified
on ANY of the permitted platforms (including the Jupiter ACE), so has 
simultaneously become the worst CGC entry on all of those systems at the same
time.
If I didn't rank this (which consists solely of the line "10 CLS") last in the

exists? Thanks ADJB, you gave us one to remember (or should I say forget)
