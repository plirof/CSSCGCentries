Hello , I'm the Redefine Keys The Adventure 2008. What is your name?

Now, that the introduction is made lets say something else :
Now, its time for you to try the ULTIMATE game.

Redefining keys have never been more realistic!!!


-------------
Description
-------------
Redefine Keys The Adventure 2008 is an amazing and superb game that will have you abandon War Of Warcraft, Medal Of Honor & all the other games that are in the market.
It will challenge all your skills even physical (eg you could run arround the room while you play this game).

-------------
Instructions:
-------------
The game features an interactive full AI help system that handles the helping system.
So, just follow the instructions of the game.

-------------
Controls:
-------------
All controls re fully redefinable!
This game lets the user select from a great variety of control methods.
The alpha version of this game that was released in the early 70s,was the first program that
allowed to redefine the X-Y axis of the Wii Stick on the ORIGINAL SPECTRUM!!
Also , this program lets you redefine the voice commands .

Cause of a misconfiguration in the internal voice recognition instruction set of the z80 ,the process is done 4 times faster than the normal speed.
This has the advantage that the voice commands are instantly recognized but you must speak 4 times slower to allow the system to understand you.


---------------
Main features :
---------------
-Realistic descriptions!!
-Amazing backgrounds taken from National GEographic Mags. 
-The redefine keyboard algorithm is the most advanced ever written.

-A team of professional programmers & cooks were hired 
  just to make sure  the game is realistic

Requirements:
---------------
-A normal spectrum emulator -if you want to take a glipse of this game.
-A spectrum with 4GB Ram (not shared) required if you want to use the 
   quad core undocumented features of the game.
   (sorry,but a real specrum is required because all the emulators are very 
    poorly coded so they can't understand the hidden spectrum intrustions 
	that the AI machine uses)

---------------
Known Bugs:
---------------
-NO BUGS. Only features!

-Linus Gates : "That game will change the way we think of the 'select your keys' methods we used so far!!"
-Clive Torvald : "Where is the 3rd street ? I think I'm lost and you guys are the only ones that will talk to me. Btw,what is a 'spectrum'? "
