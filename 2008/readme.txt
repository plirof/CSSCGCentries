Thank you for downloading the CSSCGC 2008 archive zip file.

Contents:

results.txt - The CSSCGC 2008 competition results. Contains title, author,
filename, platform, score, ranking and judgment of each submission.
Arranged in descending order from winner to loser.

submissions/ - Contains the actual competition submissions. There were 123
submissions to CSSCGC 2008 and so you will find exactly 123 files in here. Where
individual entries originally consisted of multiple files, they have been zipped
into a single file.

tapemags/ - The tape magazines that I put together and released during CSSCGC
2008. Eight of them where made during the competition. the "Feb" and "Dec"
editions run on a ZX Spectrum 48K. All others have 128K chip music.

forum/ - There was a CSSCGC 2008 web forum set up for the duration of the
competition. This is archived here. The pages are in Internet Explorer .mht "web
archive" format. Although, given more time I would have preferred a more 
platform-neutral format, it was a quick, convenient of preserving the look
and feel of the entire forum pages completely intact and with only a single file
per thread.

Enjoy!,
