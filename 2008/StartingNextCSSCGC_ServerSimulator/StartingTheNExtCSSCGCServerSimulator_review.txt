Here is another very appropriate "final day of the compo" entry for CSSCGC 2008. For some reason, I just can't shake that feeling of "It's the last day, bring a toy in" that we used to get at school.
Well I have to admit to laughing out loud at playing this one. I won't spoil the surprise by showing the content of the game in the screenshot, so that's just taken from the intro page. As you can see, it has the "Firelord" hallmark about it!

I played this until I got up the part which is almost as tense and nerve racking as the film "Juggernaut". Kinda makes you feel like Richard Harris as you attempt to hurredly deal with a potentially disasterous hardware crisis!
