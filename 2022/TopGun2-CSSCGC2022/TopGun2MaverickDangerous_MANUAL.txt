The story so far
----------------
Blind test pilot Captain Peter "Maverick Dangerous" Pan has purposely dodged an advancement in rank to continue flying after thirty-six years of service. One day, Maverick Dangerous is summoned to be put in charge of training a group of Top Gun graduates for a specialized mission under the orders of his fellow naval aviator friend and former rival, Admiral Tom "Kazan Dibi" Cruise, who is the commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet,a decorated war hero and the proud owner of a Huawei mobile phone. Among them is Lieutenant Brad "Candy Candy" Pit, the son of Maverick's best friend Dick "Tiny" Small.

When Maverick Dangerous arrives, he is told by his commanding officers that the elite group of Top Gun pilots has been assembled for a special mission against a nameless hostile mountainous nation, called the "Mountainoobs" that has started to make facilities for cheap IPhone Clones, with the intent to sell them in the United States. The assembled team under Maverick Dangerous is charged with the duty of preemptively destroying the I-Phone clone facility in spite of its highly peculiar location deep inside a mountainous canyon protected by multiple SAM and FRED missile sites. Maverick meets the team of elite pilots, who greet him coldly. One of them, Jake "Sport Billy" Thesnake, cynically keeps his distance from the other pilots, including Maverick Dangerous. There is high tension between Maverick Dangerous, Candy Candy and Sport Billy when they meet, which at times breaks out into vented hostility and an almost thumb-fingerfight between Sport Billy and Candy Candy after the latter talks about Candy Candy's father and the circumstances that led to his divorse. When the training begins and the pilots see Maverick Dangerous's skills while flying blind during training dogfights, the other pilots begin to re-assess their skepticism about Maverick Dangerous and most of them grow to appreciate Maverick Dangerous's talent for air combat.

- Shoot for the moon. Even if you fail, youâ€™ll land among the stars.

- If there exists no possibility of failure, then victory is meaningless.
- It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends
